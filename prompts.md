Can you create a three.js template in this directory? I want to use vite as a build tool, and I just want to use javascript.

I'm getting these errors on chrome dev tools: {error-message}

I want to build a 3d rpg. which components will I need to build this?


4
i want to build an infinite world generator. this is going to be a 3d rpg game. so i want some trees, rocks, some bushes, buildings, and i want the terrain to have some hills and some water as well. make everything in low-poly art style.

6.
add a new low-poly road and big building apartment class. and also put many buildings on the map.



7.
make the player look more human like, using low-poly art style. it should have a head arms legs and body

I want to make sure the main player starts the game on a land, instead of water. it is currently starting on water

8.
the player can go down into terrarin. why does it happen? what kind of game systems i need to prevent this?


9. what would be the best way of adding a collision system here? think about some ways, but don't implement it. My player goes down under terrain when it goes on that. I want it to climb to that in those cases

> it recommends something relevant to my codebase!

10. Yes, please with the approach that you recommend


Others that worked well:
your solution worked, but now, the player seem a bit above of the surface. why this is happening? I want him to be just above the terrain, not about 1-2 meters above


improve the collision system so that if the player collides with LowPoly objects, it bounces back from it. Right now, the player can pass through trees, buildings, and other added objects





9. [UNSESSFUL PATH AFTER THIS]
please make some code reorganization, so i have a folder for systems for such as collision detection or gravity or all other new ones. the codebase should be highly extensible. 


10.
I'm still having the same error.

Think deeply about and try finding 3-5 reasons this error might be happening.

```
{error-message}
```

11.
yes, implement those changes. also add much more many logs to the code. so we can monitor what is happening and debug more easily

12.
After you add logs, I start getting this message on chrome dev tools. seems like we are one step closer to the solution thanks to the logging:

```
{logs}
```






others:
replace the orbital camera with a first person camera attached to the player

Use throw errors and assertions extensively. Obsessively check code for potential issues. Whole app should stop and throw error for issues.
